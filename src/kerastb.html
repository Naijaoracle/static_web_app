      <h1>Tuberculosis Prediction</h1>
      <p>Chest x-rays are a very common imaging tool in healthcare. This means the ability to pick up tuberculosis from a chest x-ray is something that may be beneficial to patients. Eventually we may expand this model to identify other conditions from chest x-rays.</p>
      <p>In the previous example <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/tuberculosis-chestxray"> here</a> we used a convolutional neural network to classify x-rays into positive or negative for TB. It was based on the python library pytorch.</p>
      <p>This model attempts to carry out the same task using the keras deep learning library. Similar to the previous example, we will go through the steps of preprocessing our data, training our model, and visualising the output.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>The project aims to achieve an accurate and reliable classification model for TB detection in chest X-ray images.</p>
      <p>The notebook above showcases the use of a keras based convolutional neural network to classify chest x-rays based on the presence or abscence of tuberculosis. We can view it in comparison to the pythorch based model <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/tuberculosis-chestxray"> here</a>. This model had an accuracy of 59.26% on the testing data. This is far too poor, we will make some changes this keras model to improve it's performance.</p>
      <p>Next we will make some modifications to the code for this model to see if it can achieve a better performace at this task. <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/kerastb01"> see changes here</a>.</p>
