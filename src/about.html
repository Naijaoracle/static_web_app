      <h2>Volunteering Experience</h2>
        <section id="Volunteering Experience">
        <h3>Rural Medical/Surgical Outreach, 2016.</h3>
        <p>In 2016, while serving as the Mission Secretary of my schools chapter of the Christian Medical and Dental Association Nigeria - Students, I played a leading role in organising a medical outreach to a rural community in another state.</p>
        <p>The participants included surgeons, nurses, community physicians, medical students, and others. About 610 patients received free medical consultations and about 50 patients received free surgeries.</p>
        <p>Prior to this I had participated in outreaches, but this one also gave me an opportunity to take a leadership role. Ultimately it was a great opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of those who needed it but were unable to find solutions. </p>
