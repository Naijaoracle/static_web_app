      <h2>Malaria parasite detection</h2>
        <section id="Malaria parasite detection">
        <p>Malaria is a very common disease in many parts of the world, particularly the tropics. It is responsible for many deaths every year. The disease is caused by the plasmodium parasite, which is spread by the females of the Anopheles mosquito genus.</p>
        <p>Being able to accurately identify the presence of the plasmodium parasite in a sample will increase the identification of individuals requiring treatment. This project aims to build a model, and eventually a panel of tools to aid in the rapid diagnosis of malaria, and to allow personnel switch to screening out other illnesses in time if a patient tests negative.</p>
        <p>Inspiration for this project is drawn from the work of Saurav mishrav which achieved a high performance at this classification task. You can read the academic paper on this <a href="https://doi.org/10.35882/jeeemi.v3i3.2">here</a>. </p>
