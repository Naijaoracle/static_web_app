      <h1>Tuberculosis Prediction</h1>
      <p>Chest x-rays are a very common imaging tool in healthcare. This means the ability to pick up tuberculosis from a chest x-ray is something that may be beneficial to patients. Eventually we may expand this model to identify other conditions from chest x-rays.</p>
      <p>In a previous test <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/tuberculosis-chestxray"> here</a> we used a convolutional neural network to classify x-rays into positive or negative for TB. It was based on the python library pytorch.</p>
      <p>This model is an attempt to improve the first model built on the deep learning library keras <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/kerastb">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>The project aims to achieve an accurate and reliable classification model for TB detection in chest X-ray images.</p>
      <p>The notebook above shows the use of a keras based convolutional neural network to classify chest x-rays based on the presence or abscence of tuberculosis. We can view it in comparison to the pythorch based model <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/tuberculosis-chestxray"> here</a>. This model is an improvement on the first keras model <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/kerastb"> here</a>. There is still a lot left to do to bump those numbers up.</p>
      <p>In the next phase, we will explore the use of pretrained models and assess their performance at this task.</p>
