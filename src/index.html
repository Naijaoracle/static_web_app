      <h1>Welcome to My Digital Health & AI Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm David Dasa, a Medical Doctor on a path to explore the intersection of healthcare and 
technology. Currently pursuing an MSc in Digital Health & Artificial Intelligence, I seek to leverage technology's potential to 
enhance healthcare solutions.

With five years of clinical experience, I've navigated high-pressure medical situations, leading cardiac responses and 
coordinating postoperative care. My journey is fueled by a vision to integrate innovative technology into healthcare practices, 
aiming to create impactful solutions for real-world challenges.

From conducting research on primary eye care to organizing medical missions, I'm committed to innovation and patient-centric 
care.

Join me in exploring the dynamic realm where medicine meets technology, as we strive to reshape the future of healthcare.</p>
