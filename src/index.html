      <h1>Welcome to My Digital Health & AI Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome! I'm David Dasa, a Medical Doctor on a path to explore the intersection of healthcare and 
technology. Currently pursuing an MSc in Digital Health & Artificial Intelligence, I seek to leverage technology's potential to 
enhance healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>With years of clinical experience, I've navigated high-pressure medical situations, leading cardiac arrest responses and 
coordinating postoperative care. My journey is fueled by a vision to integrate innovative technology into healthcare practice, 
aiming to create impactful solutions to real-world challenges.</p>

<p>From conducting research on the use of blockchain technology in healthchare, to organizing medical outreach missions. I am committed to innovation and patient-centric 
care.</p>

<p>Join me in exploring the dynamic realm where medicine meets technology, as we strive to shape the future of healthcare.</p>
      <p>Please take a look around and feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddasa">get in touch</a> on LinkedIn.</p>

        <b>Remote patient monitoring system</b>
        <p>
          A project to build a remote patient monitoring system which uses short range bluetooth low energy medical devices, verifies proximity to a trusted device, and sends the data to medical professionals who verify the data is from a trusted device, saving it to a distributed ledger running a proof of authority consensus protocol.</p>
